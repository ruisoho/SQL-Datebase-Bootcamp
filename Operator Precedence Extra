Always remember the following: HIGHEST to LOWEST


1. Parenthesis

2. Arithmetic Operators

3. Concatenation Operators

4. Comparison Conditions

5. IS NULL, LIKE, NOT IN, etc.

6. NOT

7. AND

8. OR


Note here that OR is the lowest on the totem pole, we also need to make a couple of corrections, in the videos you saw the following queries:


    age > 20 
    AND salary > 1000
    AND gender = 'f'
    AND NOT state = 'NY'


The order here is:

1. Age > 20

2. Salary > 1000

3. NOT from NY

4. Gender female


You also saw:


    age > 20 
    OR age < 30
    AND salary > 1000
    AND NOT state = 'NY'
    AND NOT state = 'OR'


The order here is:

1. Over 20

2. Younger than 30

3. Salary > 1000

4. NOT from NY

5. NOT from OR


If we did the following:

    age > 20 
    OR age < 30
    AND salary > 1000
    AND (NOT state = 'NY'
    AND NOT state = 'OR')


The order here is (due to parenthesis):

1. NOT from NY

2. NOT from OR

3. Over 20

4. Younger than 30

5. Salary > 1000
